## 🧠 Key Business Insights

### ⏰ Sales Timing Optimization
- Sales are consistently low **between 10 AM – 11 AM** and **after 10 PM**
- ⚠️ These time slots generate almost no revenue but still incur operating costs  
➡️ **Recommendation**: Shift shop hours to **11 AM – 10 PM** to reduce overhead and maximize ROI

### 🧾 Combo Opportunity from Item Affinity
- Frequently paired items include:
  - *Edamame + Hamburger*
  - *French Fries + Korean Beef Bowl*
  - *Cheeseburger + Edamame*
- ⚡ Customers often buy these together  
➡️ **Recommendation**: Offer them as **combo deals with discounts** to increase order value
